# xtra

A tiny, fast, and safe actor framework. It is modelled around Actix (copyright and license [here](https://github.com/Restioson/xtra/blob/master/LICENSE-ACTIX)).

## Features

- **Safe:** there is no unsafe code in xtra.
- **Tiny:** xtra is only around 2000 LoC.
- **Lightweight:** xtra has few dependencies, most of which are lightweight (except `futures`).
- Asynchronous `Handler` interface which allows `async`/`await` syntax with `&mut self`.
- Does not depend on its own runtime and can be run with any futures executor. Convenience `spawn` functions are provided
  for [Tokio](https://tokio.rs/), [async-std](https://async.rs/), [smol](https://github.com/stjepang/smol), and 
  [wasm-bindgen-futures](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-bindgen/api/wasm_bindgen_futures/).
- Quite fast. Running on Tokio, <170ns time from sending a message to it being processed for sending without waiting for a 
result on my development machine with an AMD Ryzen 3 3200G.

## Example
```rust
use xtra::prelude::*;

#[derive(Default, xtra::Actor)]
struct Printer {
    times: usize,
}

struct Print(String);

impl Handler<Print> for Printer {
    type Return = ();

    async fn handle(&mut self, print: Print, _ctx: &mut Context<Self>) {
        self.times += 1;
        println!("Printing {}. Printed {} times so far.", print.0, self.times);
    }
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let addr = xtra::spawn_tokio(Printer::default(), None);
    loop {
        addr.send(Print("hello".to_string()))
            .await
            .expect("Printer should not be dropped");
    }
}

```

## Okay, sounds great! How do I use it?

Check out the [docs](https://docs.rs/xtra) and the [examples](https://github.com/Restioson/xtra/tree/master/xtra/examples) to get started!
Enabling the `tokio`, `async_std`, `smol`, or `wasm_bindgen` features is recommended in order to enable some  convenience methods (such as `xtra::spawn_tokio`).
Which you enable will depend on which executor you want to use (check out their docs to learn more about each).
If you have any questions, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/Restioson/xtra/issues/new) or message me on the [Rust discord](https://bit.ly/rust-community).

Keep in mind that `xtra` has a MSRV of 1.60.0.

## Cargo features

- `async_std`: enables integration with [async-std](https://async.rs/).
- `smol`: enables integration with [smol](https://github.com/smol-rs/smol).
  Note that this requires smol 1.1 as 1.1 had a minor breaking change from 1.0 which leads to xtra no longer compiling on 1.0 and 1.1 simultaneously.
- `tokio`: enables integration with [tokio](https://tokio.rs).
- `wasm_bindgen`: enables integration with [wasm-bindgen](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen), and particularly its futures crate.
- `instrumentation`: Adds a dependency on `tracing` and creates spans for message sending and handling on actors.
- `sink`: Adds `Address::into_sink` and `MessageChannel::into_sink`.
- `macros`: Enables the `Actor` custom derive macro.
