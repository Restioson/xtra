/// An [`Address`] is a reference to an actor through which messages can be sent.
///
/// [`Address`]es can be cloned to obtain more addresses to the same actor.
/// By default (i.e without specifying the second type parameter, `Rc`, to be
/// [`Weak`], [`Address`]es are strong. Therefore, when all [`Address`]es
/// are dropped, the actor will be stopped. In other words, any existing [`Address`]es will inhibit
/// the dropping of an actor. If this is undesirable, then a [`WeakAddress`]
/// should be used instead.
///
/// The initial [`Address`] of an actor is returned when you construct a new [`Mailbox`](crate::Mailbox).
///
/// ## Mailboxes
///
/// Internally, a mailbox has three, more specific mailboxes, each for a specific kind of message:
/// 1. The default priority, or ordered mailbox.
/// 2. The priority mailbox.
/// 3. The broadcast mailbox.
///
/// The first two mailboxes are shared between all actors on the same address, whilst each actor
/// has its own broadcast mailbox.
///
/// The actor's mailbox capacity applies severally to each mailbox. This means that an actor can
/// have a total of `cap` messages in every mailbox before it is totally full. However, it must only
/// have `cap` in a given mailbox for any sends to that mailbox to be caused to wait for free space
/// and thus exercise backpressure on senders.
///
/// ### Default priority
///
/// The default priority mailbox contains messages which will be handled in order of sending. This is
/// a special property, as the other two mailboxes do not preserve send order!
/// The vast majority of actor messages will probably be sent to this mailbox. They have default
/// priority - a message will be taken from this mailbox next only if the other two mailboxes are empty.
///
/// ### Priority
///
/// The priority mailbox contains messages which will be handled in order of their priority.This
/// can be used to make sure that critical maintenance tasks such as pings are handled as soon as
/// possible. Keep in mind that if this becomes full, attempting to send in a higher priority message
/// than the current highest will still result in waiting for at least one priority message
/// to be handled.
///
/// ### Broadcast
///
/// The broadcast mailbox contains messages which will be handled by every single actor, in order
/// of their priority. All actors must handle a message for it to be removed from the mailbox and
/// the length to decrease. This means that the backpressure provided by [`Address::broadcast`] will
/// wait for the slowest actor.
