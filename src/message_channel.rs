/// A message channel is a channel through which you can send only one kind of message, but to
/// any actor that can handle it. It is like [`Address`](../address/struct.Address.html), but associated with
/// the message type rather than the actor type. This trait represents *any kind of message channel*.
/// There are two traits which inherit from it - one for
/// [weak message channels](trait.WeakMessageChannel.html), and one for
/// [strong message channels](trait.StrongMessageChannel.html). Both of these traits may be
/// downcasted to this trait using their respective `downcast` methods. Therefore, this trait is
/// most useful when you want to be generic over both strong and weak message channels. If this is
/// undesireable or not needed, simply use their respective trait objects instead.
